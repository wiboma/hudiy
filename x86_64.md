## Introduction

As of version 2.2, Hudiy also supports the x86 64-bit architecture. The currently supported Operating System is Debian Trixie 64-bit with a graphical environment (e.g., Gnome or labwc).

Since the installation, configuration and updating process for Hudiy requires root privileges, access to sudo is necessary. In Debian, sudo access is automatically provided when a password is not set for the root user. Please keep that in mind during OS installation and do not set the root password.

Hudiy utilizes the VA-API (Video Acceleration API) for hardware acceleration. Therefore, for a better user experience, we recommend running Hudiy on platforms that support VA-API (<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/linuxmedia-vaapi.html>).

**We do not recommend and officially do not support** running Hudiy on Virtual Machines (e.g., QEMU, VirtualBox, or VMWare). Virtual Machines do not provide sufficient hardware support for handling UI (OpenGL) and video rendering, and may also cause issues with PipeWire. Any additional system configuration required on a Virtual Machine is the responsibility of the user.
